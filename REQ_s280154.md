# Stories and personas
John has a large family and uses his car frequently both to bring his children to school and to go to work. He has always a tight schedule and he does not have financial problems. He would like to know every time which is the closest gas station to him so that he does not lose time finding one.

Paul and his group of friends are planning a road trip through Spain for the summer, they would like to save as much as possible on fuel. They would like to know the cheapest gas stations they can use along their trip.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1 Record a new gas station
| Actors Involved        | User, Map service |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | User visits a gas station GS which is not present in the system|  
|  Post condition     | The gas station GS is now inserted and visible in the system|
|  Nominal Scenario     | User selects the position on the map and decide to add the gas station GS inserting the informations in a specific form |
|  Variants     | The inserted information is not complete, then the system will rely on other users to update them and complete the gas station page |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Update information of a gas station
| Actors Involved        | User, Map service |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition       | User visit a gas station GS already present in the system and wants to update its information |  
|  Post condition     | The information of gas station GS are now updated |
|  Nominal Scenario   | User selects gas station GS from the map or the list, then selects the information he wants to update and provides the new ones|
|  Variants           | User inserts a value equal to the previous one, the update is not performed. |
|| User can decide to update fuel prices or other information related to the gas station GS.|| User may inserts wrong information, the system rely on other user to correct them. |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 Interacts with Map Service
| Actors Involved        | Map service |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     |  |  
|  Post condition   |  |
|  Nominal Scenario |  |
|  Variants     	|  |

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4 Delete a gas station
| Actors Involved        | Administrator , User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | A user finds a gas station GS which is now closed and wants to delete it from the system |  
|  Post condition     | GS is no more present in the system |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User wants to delete GS, to do so he compiles a form in the gas station page, the administrator then delete GS from the system|
|  Variants     | Information can be incorrect, then the system will rely on other users to re-insert the gas station.|
||The information can be incomplete or non exhaustive, then the developer can contact the user using the email used in the form. |

### Use case 5, UC5 - FR5 Research gas stations

| Actors Involved        | User, Map service |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     |  User U wants to search a gas station |  
|  Post condition     | User U has found a gas station which corresponds to his needs |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User U inserts some filters as fuel type, maximum price, location or distance, then the system will provide a list or a map of the different gas stations |
|  Variants     |  |

# Relevant scenarios

## Scenario 1

| Scenario ID: SC1        | Corresponds to UC2  |
| ------------- |:-------------|

| Step#        |  Step description   |
|  1     | User select gas station GS |  
|  2     | User select the option to update the price |
|  3     | User select the fuel type F |
|  4     | User enters the new price P |
|  5     | User confirm the change |

## Scenario 2
